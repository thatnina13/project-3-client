# Project 3 client

# Application Title: Party On
This application allows the user to Party. More specifically, this SPA allows a user to view existing parties without having to sign up or sign in- making sure that everyone who wants to party, knows which parties are out there! Additionally, after signing in, a user can create a party, update a party, delete a party and view their RSVPs.
But why? why go through all the trouble to create a web app mainly for cataloging parties? Because parties are excellent. (please read this sentence in Garth voice)

## Planning Story
It was early on Tuesday Morning, when Caley, Simon, Ryan and Nina came together to talk over the "hangout" prompt. As a group, the four broke down the different requirements and their associated features for both the back end and the front end.
Simon and Ryan paired off to Para-program the front end, specifically they html  and handlebars framework for each feature, as Caley and Nina tackled the API for GET, SHOW and DELETE Parties. Following a schedule that divided each day into two mini sprints with Stand-ups in the morning, before lunch and before end of day- MPV was reached by end of day Wednesday 1/8/2020. Thursday was use to focus on styling and functionality of myRSVP button, which would return the Parties the signed in user had RSVP'ed too.

### Unsolved Problems & Future Goals
Along side of additional styling for a bettered user experience, Party On has one unsolved problem. Our delete function is, at present, deleting the owner key but not the user key. This bug allows a user to update the owner of an RSVP or Party. 
Additionally, future iterations of Party On will ideally notify party owners when an RSVP is submitted for a party.
